# [M.Portfolio](maxliu2001.github.io/m.portfolio/): Personal Website

Welcome! This page is the dev hub of my personal website. It's more or less of an interactive resume that jots down my piror experieneces, projects and interests. This is the earliest project on my Github account. I started this project during high school. This project has been updated significantly over the years as my technical skills grew. Currently, the static page is a placeholder for the newest version of my personal website that's coming under the way. 

## Features in the new website
- React.js, Next.js
- MaterialUI
- Framer Motion
